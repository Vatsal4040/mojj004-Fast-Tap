# Fast Tap

A minimal reaction-time game.

The screen waits, then turns green.
Tap as fast as you can.

Your best reaction time is saved locally.

## Why this game exists
Fast Tap is designed to be:
- Immediate
- Skill-based
- Replayable in seconds

There are no levels, no settings, and no distractions.
Just reflex.

## How it works
- Tap to start
- Wait for the screen to turn green
- Tap immediately
- Reaction time is measured in milliseconds

If you tap too early, the attempt fails.

## Persistence
- Best time is stored using `localStorage`
- No accounts
- No backend

## Design principles
- Pure black background
- One interaction
- Mobile-first
- No animations beyond necessity
- No refactors unless required for bugs

## Status
✅ Locked  
Gameplay and logic should not be changed.
